This GitHub repo leverages GitLab CI/CD. The CI/CD file is initially configured in GitHub and is mirrored to GitLab via a pull mirror. The integration is set up to trigger a pull mirror on push and PR events. 

[Steps to configure the integration manually](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/ci_cd_for_external_repos/github_integration.html#connect-manually)

This must be connected manually for GitHub Enterprise to GitLab. You can configure GitLab CI/CD for external repositories otherwise [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/ci_cd_for_external_repos/#limitations)
